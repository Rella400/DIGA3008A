        <h1>Navigate My Journey</h1>

        <h2>Hi, My name is Sisanda</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio, where creativity meets functionality. Just like a journey on the open road, my work is about 
            exploration, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Buckle up as I take you through my projects, experiences, and insights in the 
            world of design and development.</p>

        <!-- Start the journey Button + Once pressed, have an animation of a car speeding to the end of the screen and the screen fading 
         out/flipping towards the next page where the reader will get an overview of all the pages with their links and what they are for. 
         The top of the page should include the motivation for your website (Especially the larning to drive part)-->

        <!-- Add "/Road Map" (In the Start the Journey page) with smaller word below it saying 'What to expect'" section (Which will fall under the about section) 
         which explains what the website contains including why there is a learn how to drive page/My motivation. This must 
         redirect the user to the profile/about me page -->
