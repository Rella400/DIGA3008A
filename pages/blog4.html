            …h3…strong…Website Goals and Purpose
…p…The primary goal of my website is to serve as a publicly hosted, interactive portfolio that showcases my skills and achievements while simultaneously helping me study for my learner’s and driver’s licenses. As a digital arts student and aspiring game designer, I aim to present my creative and technical abilities in a cohesive and professional manner. At the same time, I want to incorporate interactive elements and educational resources related to the K53 driving manual to aid in my preparation for my learner’s and driver’s tests. The website, therefore, must balance these dual objectives, providing an engaging and informative experience for both visitors interested in my portfolio and those looking for driving study resources.
To address the varied needs of my audience, I have established clear user goals. Visitors—including potential employers, lecturers, and peers—should be able to view my work, read my blog, and gain insight into my creative process and technical skills. Learners, including myself, will have access to driving-related information and study resources presented in a way that makes learning feel interactive and enjoyable. One of my key content goals is to clearly differentiate between portfolio content and driving study resources while maintaining a seamless and intuitive navigation experience between sections.
…h3…strong…Information Structure and Navigation
…p…To achieve these goals, I have carefully planned the information structure using a mind map. This map includes key sections such as the Homepage, Blog Section, Design Section, Essay Section, and Profile/Portfolio Pages. The Homepage will introduce the website and offer quick links to the primary sections, while the Blog Section will feature posts about my personal journey, project updates, and driving tips. The Design Section will showcase my visual and interactive projects, highlighting my skills as a digital artist and game designer. The Essay Section will host my academic writing and critical reflections, and the Profile/Portfolio Pages will present a comprehensive breakdown of my skills and achievements. Throughout the site, similar content will be grouped together to maintain coherence and clarity, while unrelated content—such as portfolio projects versus driving manual study materials—will be distinctly separated to avoid confusion.
To guide users through the site effectively, I have considered the user flow and designed a chronological pathway for navigation. The Homepage will lead to a section navigation page that previews all the main content areas. From there, users can easily access specific pages, such as blog posts or project showcases. The Blog Page will offer related posts and comment sections to enhance interactivity, while the Design Section will direct users to project pages and media viewers. I plan to include user interaction points such as dropdown menus, tabs, and search bars for easy access to content. Additionally, contact forms and comment sections will allow for user feedback and engagement.
…h3…strong…Interface Design and Visual Aesthetics
…p…The interface elements will include input controls such as buttons for reading more about blog posts, text fields for searching, and dropdown menus for navigation. Navigational components like breadcrumbs will track users' progress through the site, while pagination will be used for blog content. Informational components will include tooltips for explaining icon meanings and progress bars for tracking study progress on driving-related pages.
Visually, the website will follow a driving manual theme with bold, clear signs and road-themed UI elements. The color scheme will be inspired by road signs, utilizing colors like yellow, white, and red to create a visually intuitive hierarchy. The typeface will be clean and readable, akin to official driving documents. I have developed basic wireframes that consider both layout and content flow. These wireframes will be annotated with details about interaction points and visual design elements to ensure consistency throughout the site.
…h3…strong…Reflection and Next Steps
…p…Reflecting on my original wireframes, I found that they successfully captured the main sections and navigation flow. However, after analyzing the Interaction Design (IxD) Process, I realized that I need to improve the clarity and consistency of the navigation bar and add more visual hierarchy to the Design Section to highlight key projects. Additionally, I plan to make the Homepage more engaging by incorporating a brief introduction and quick links to recent blog posts and projects.
To move forward, I will refine the wireframes, making adjustments based on the IxD Process to improve navigation clarity and emphasize visual hierarchy on important pages. I will also develop a detailed style guide to define fonts, colors, spacing rules, and the consistent use of UI elements. Finally, I will continue to add annotations and reflections as the project evolves to document my design decisions and their alignment with the IxD Process.
