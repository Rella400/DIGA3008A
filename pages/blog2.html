       <h2><strong>Reflecting on Hypertext, Interaction, and Website Design</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Revisiting Hypertext: Moulthrop’s Vision and the Modern Internet</strong></h3>
<p>In his 2003 piece You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991), Stuart Moulthrop explores how hypertext promised to revolutionize digital communication by allowing for nonlinear, multi-path storytelling and information sharing. Reflecting on his ideas over two decades later, it’s fascinating to see how hypertext has become an integral part of the internet. Yet, rather than liberating readers from linear narratives, many modern websites and platforms have constrained interaction within algorithm-driven feeds and rigid structures.
</p>
    <p>The hypertextual vision of endless exploration still thrives on niche websites, interactive fiction, and immersive digital experiences. However, mainstream platforms favor content curation that minimizes the agency of users in navigating content. This contrast makes me wonder whether the potential of hypertext has been fully realized or compromised in pursuit of monetization and control. My project aims to embrace interactivity by giving users more control over their experience, much like Moulthrop envisioned.
    </p>
        <h3><strong>Interaction and the World Wide Web: My Perspective</strong></h3>
<p>
        To me, interaction means fostering a sense of agency and engagement. I want my website to encourage exploration and discovery, reflecting how hypertext was originally imagined. Interaction isn’t just about clicking buttons or following links; it’s about creating a conversation between the user and the content. Whether it’s through intuitive navigation, interactive visuals, or dynamic content updates, I want visitors to feel like they’re actively participating in their journey through the site.
</p>
        <h3><strong>Design Decisions: Folder Structure and URL Scheme</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure an organized and efficient development process, I structured my website folders as follows:</p>
<p>project-root/
├── index.html      # Homepage
├── blog.html       # Blog section
├── pages/          # Individual blog posts
├── css/            # Stylesheets
├── images/         # Visual assets and wireframes
└── scripts/        # JavaScript files </p>
<p>This structure helps me keep related content together while maintaining clear separation between presentation (CSS), content (HTML), and behavior (JS). The posts/ folder holds individual blog entries, allowing each to have a clean, dedicated URL like:
https://myportfolio.com/posts/week1.html<p>
<p>This scheme makes URLs intuitive and deas adding new posts only requires creating a new HTML file in the posts/ directory.scriptive while ensuring that navigation is smooth and consistent. It also allows for easy expansion, </p>
<h3>Inspiration and Wireframe Concepts</h3>
<p>Here are some of my first wireframe ideas:</p>
<p>In these concepts, I focus on a clean and minimal aesthetic that emphasizes clarity and ease of navigation. I want to draw inspiration from websites like Awwwards for their innovative layouts and interactivity, as well as Smashing Magazine for their balance between text-heavy content and visual appeal.</p>
<p>.Collecting references and visual inspiration is essential to grounding my ideas in practical and effective design. I aim to blend form and function, making the user experience both enjoyable and informative.</p>

            <p>I also set up my repository on GitHub, following the naming conventions discussed in lectures. This step ensured that my project is well-organized and easy to access online.</p>
