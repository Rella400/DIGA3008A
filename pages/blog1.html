            <h2>Week 1 Reflections</h2>

         <p>Setting up GitHub and using GitHub Pages was a great learning experience. It not only helped me improve my technical skills but also made me appreciate how much the internet has changed over time.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting Started with GitHub and GitHub Pages<strong></h3>
    <p>    
My journey with GitHub started with creating a repository, which is like a storage space for my project files. The platform made it easy to set up and upload my files. Using Git, I was able to keep track of changes and work more efficiently.
Publishing my website with GitHub Pages was also simple. I enabled the Pages feature in my settings and chose the right branch, and within minutes, my site was live. This showed me how easy it is to share work online with modern web tools.

<h3><strong>Reflections on the Readings</strong></h3>
<p>
Jorge Luis Borges' short story The Library of Babel describes a vast library with endless books containing every possible combination of letters. This reminds me of the internet today—an overwhelming amount of information where we must sort through the chaos to find what we need.
Alan Turing’s paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence discusses whether machines can think like humans. He introduces the Turing Test, which checks if a computer can imitate human responses well enough to fool people. Today, we see AI everywhere, from chatbots to personalized recommendations, proving how far technology has come since Turing’s time.
Reading about the history of the web helped me understand how the internet evolved. The first web browser launched in 1990, and over time, platforms like Gopher and technologies like HTML helped shape the web. Looking back at these milestones shows how quickly the internet has changed.
The dot-com bubble in the late 1990s is an example of how technology can grow too fast. Many companies became extremely valuable, but when the bubble burst, they collapsed. This teaches us that while innovation is exciting, businesses also need long-term stability.
The story of Flash was also interesting. Flash was once a key tool for animations and interactive content, but it eventually became outdated and was replaced by better technology. This shows how digital tools come and go, and staying updated is important in web development.

The web has gone through many changes. It started with simple pages and grew into the dynamic, interactive internet we use today. The

    <h3><strong>My Goals for This Course</strong></h3>
</p> 
My main goal in this course is to learn how to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to create a well-designed and user-friendly site that showcases my skills. By learning from the history of the web, I hope to design a website that not only looks good now but can also adapt to future changes.
