        <p>Documenting my journey in web development, design, and learning how to drive. This blog captures my reflections, progress, challenges, and successes while building my portfolio website.</p>

            <h3 class="entry-title">Week 1</h3>
            <time datetime="2025-02-17" class="published">February 17, 2025 </time>
            <p>In the first week, I focused on understanding semantic markup. I learned how HTML elements can provide contextual meaning to browsers and assistive technologies. This foundational knowledge helped me structure my content in a way that improves accessibility and SEO. My main takeaway was that meaningful markup contributes to a website’s usability and discoverability.</p>
            <p>I also set up my repository on GitHub, following the naming conventions discussed in lectures. This step ensured that my project is well-organized and easy to access online.</p>

            <h3 class="entry-title">Week 2 </h3>
            <time datetime="2025-02-24" class="published">February 24, 2025 </time>
            <p>This week, I focused on structuring my content in a modular way. I organized the project folders to reflect the hierarchical information structure, making it easier to manage and scale. Additionally, I explored metadata and how it can guide browsers to interpret content efficiently. This involved adding meaningful metadata tags to each page, such as author, description, and keywords.</p>
            <p>Another key focus was incorporating microformats to make my blog posts searchable and properly indexed by search engines. I chose the h-entry microformat, which ensures that each post is well-defined and easy to reference.</p>

            <time datetime="2025-03-03" class="published">March 03, 2025</time>
            <p>This week, I focused on enhancing accessibility by using semantic HTML elements correctly and adding ARIA attributes where necessary. I also began drafting my wireframes for the design section, making sure they align with the goal of a clear, road-themed learning experience. The challenge was balancing thematic creativity with practical accessibility.</p>

            <h3 class="entry-title">Week 4</h3>
            <time datetime="2025-03-10" class="published">March 10, 2025</time>
            <p>This week was dedicated to reflection on my progress and overcoming challenges related to maintaining semantic integrity while pursuing creative presentation. I realized that while thematic elements are important, they should not compromise the website’s usability or clarity.</p>
            <p>To address this, I refined my design plan, ensuring that thematic elements like road sign graphics are complemented by clear text and descriptive headings. Additionally, I documented my progress and included reflections on what I learned from balancing aesthetics with functionality.</p>
