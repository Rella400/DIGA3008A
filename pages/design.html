            <h2>Design Approach and Conceptualization</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to merge my personal learning journey of obtaining a driving license with my portfolio of artistic and digital works. The site is themed around the K53 driving manual, incorporating elements of road signs and driving techniques to create an engaging and practical experience for users who may also be preparing for their learnerâ€™s license. The goal is to make the site visually appealing, educational, and relevant to my current goals.</p>
            <p>The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, mimicking the structured layout of road maps and signposts. This thematic approach not only aligns with the learning aspect but also makes the design memorable and personal.</p>

            <h2>UI/UX Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>The user interface (UI) is built around recognizable road sign elements to reinforce the driving theme. The navigation bar resembles a road signpost, with each link styled to resemble directional signs. Consistency in color schemes (black, white, yellow, and green) aligns with typical road sign aesthetics while maintaining high contrast and readability.</p>
            <p>User experience (UX) is enhanced through clear labeling and signpost-style guidance throughout the site. Interactive elements, such as quizzes and reflective blog posts, are structured to feel like checkpoints on a learning journey, creating a sense of progression and achievement.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>The wireframes for each section of the website were designed with simplicity and clarity in mind. Each page follows a structured format to ensure consistency and user familiarity. Below are the initial wireframe sketches:</p>
            <h3>Homepage Wireframe</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/wireframe1.png" alt="Homepage wireframe" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Wireframe for the homepage layout, featuring a navigation bar styled as a road sign and a central content area.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Portfolio Page Wireframe</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/wireframe2.png" alt="Portfolio page wireframe" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Wireframe for the portfolio page, showcasing artwork and projects as road signs leading to detailed project pages.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Design Inspirations and References</h3>
            <p>The visual inspiration for the site was drawn from real-world road signs and online driving test portals. One particular website that influenced the design was <a href="https://www.k53tests.co.za" target="_blank">K53 Tests</a>, which uses clear icons and structured layouts. I aimed to improve upon their interface by adding thematic consistency and personalized content.</p>
            <p>What I liked about K53 Tests: Structured, clear presentation and practical quiz elements.<br>
            What I did not like: Minimal aesthetic appeal and lack of engaging visuals. </p>

            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>The color palette is based on road safety standards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yellow and Black:</strong> Caution and attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Green and White:</strong> Safety and guidance.</li>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Warnings and important messages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Typography: The primary font family is 'Arial', chosen for its readability and simplicity.</p>
            <p>Buttons: Styled to look like road signs, using rounded edges and reflective colors to make them feel like real-world counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Reflections and Design Evolution</h2>
            <p>Throughout the design process, I constantly evaluated the balance between visual appeal and functional usability. One challenge was integrating the thematic elements without making the site appear cluttered. I overcame this by selectively using sign-based elements only where they added value to navigation or content presentation. Future iterations may include interactive elements such as animation on button hover to simulate movement.</p>
